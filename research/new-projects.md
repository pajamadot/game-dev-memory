## Current Feed Mix

- GitHub Blog RSS
- Hacker News RSS queries (game dev + agent tooling)
- arXiv query for agentic software projects

## Upgrade Backlog

1. Add source quality scoring and per-source reliability metrics.
2. Cross-link digest items with stack tags from project metadata.
3. Support project-specific watchlists (custom feed queries per org/project).
4. Add "promote to memory" and "dismiss" feedback loop to tune ranking.

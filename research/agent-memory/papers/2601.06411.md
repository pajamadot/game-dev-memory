## Abstract

Current approaches to memory in Large Language Models (LLMs) predominantly rely on static Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which often results in scattered retrieval and fails to capture the structural dependencies required for complex reasoning. For autonomous agents, these passive and flat architectures lack the cognitive organization necessary to model the dynamic and associative nature of long-term interaction. To address this, we propose Structured Episodic Event Memory (SEEM), a hierarchical framework that synergizes a graph memory layer for relational facts with a dynamic episodic memory layer for narrative progression. Grounded in cognitive frame theory, SEEM transforms interaction streams into structured Episodic Event Frames (EEFs) anchored by precise provenance pointers. Furthermore, we introduce an agentic associative fusion and Reverse Provenance Expansion (RPE) mechanism to reconstruct coherent narrative contexts from fragmented evidence. Experimental results on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SEEM significantly outperforms baselines, enabling agents to maintain superior narrative coherence and logical consistency.

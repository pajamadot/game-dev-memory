## Abstract

Agent memory has been touted as a dimension of growth for LLM-based applications, enabling agents that can accumulate experience, adapt across sessions, and move beyond single-shot question answering. The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions.

## What This Adds (fill in)

- Problem: Common memory layers blur evidence vs inference and struggle to stay organized and explainable over long horizons.
- Memory mechanism (write/update/retrieve/forget): Structured memory substrate with distinct networks (facts, experiences, entity summaries, beliefs) and explicit operations (retain, recall, reflect) including traceable updates.
- Evaluation / benchmarks: LongMemEval and LoCoMo; reports large gains vs full-context baselines on long-horizon conversational memory tasks.
- Failure modes / tradeoffs: More structure requires more bookkeeping and update policies; incorrect belief updates can still drift without strong evidence links.

## How This Maps To game-dev-memory (fill in)

- What to store (tables/assets): Mirror the separation: evidence assets (logs/traces) vs derived summaries vs "belief" (hypotheses) entries; keep links that explain derivation.
- Retrieval pattern: Retrieve facts/evidence first, then experiences, then summaries/beliefs; avoid mixing them into one top-k blob.
- Evolution trigger: Reflection step should be able to update beliefs and summaries with explicit provenance, without rewriting raw evidence.
- UI affordance: A "fact vs hypothesis" view in the UI, plus an audit trail for belief updates ("what evidence caused this change").

## Abstract

Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory that preserves specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information. Our approach utilises a generic memory template applicable to new problems without the need to hand-craft specific memory prompts. We benchmark our approach on the PDDL, FEVER, and ALFWorld datasets, comparing its performance to existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing state-of-the-art or comparable performance across all three, with the highest consistency. An additional evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, and we demonstrate that our approach produces higher quality designs across 5 metrics: scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness, and documentation, plus additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that addressing memory limitations through intrinsic approaches can improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning tasks.

## Abstract

Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable consistency during prolonged dialogues by storing relevant memories and incorporating them as context. Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private. However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment. Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance. Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency. On text-only operations, MemLoRA outperforms 10$\times$ larger baseline models (e.g., Gemma2-27B) and achieves performance comparable to 60$\times$ larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B) on the LoCoMo benchmark. To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning. On this, our VLM-integrated MemLoRA-V shows massive improvements over caption-based approaches (81.3 vs. 23.7 accuracy) while keeping strong performance in text-based tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in multimodal contexts.
